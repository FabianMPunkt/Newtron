This little project is made to read the USBSerial output of one these ["TesT"-devices](https://www.test-gmbh.com/de/produkte/pruefmaschinen/einfache-pruefrahmen/modell-105/).
It will process the readings, turn them all into positive values and save the highest value.

With the press of a button the highest value will the be sent to the computer using the "Keyboard.h" library.


The TesT-device trannsmits all the values over its USBSerial Port in a single line as seen in [these readings](misc/OG_readings.txt).
GitHub's formatting doen't disply this correctly though. All the values are in-fact separated by a ""

A detailed build guide & more info can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Newtron/wiki).
